# Opencodian

Opencodian is an Obsidian plugin that embeds OpenCode AI as a sidebar chat interface. By treating your Obsidian vault as the working directory, it provides full agentic capabilities, including file reading/writing, bash command execution, and complex multi-step workflows.

## Features

- **Embedded AI Agent**: Integrate OpenCode AI directly into your Obsidian sidebar.
- **Vault Context**: The agent operates with your vault as its working directory.
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Supports file operations, terminal commands, and autonomous workflows.

## Development

1. **Build**: `npm run build`
2. **Dev Mode**: `npm run dev`
3. **Lint**: `npm run lint`
